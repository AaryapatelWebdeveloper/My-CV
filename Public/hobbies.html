    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>One of my favorite hobbies is flying planes using flight simulators. I’ve always been fascinated by aviation, and flight simulation allows me to experience the thrill of piloting an aircraft from the comfort of my own setup. Whether it's taking off from busy international airports, navigating through various weather conditions, or learning about flight controls and navigation systems, simulators help me dive deep into the technical world of aviation. It’s more than just a game for me—it's a learning experience that sharpens my focus, coordination, and decision-making skills.</li>
    <li>In addition to flight simulation, I have a strong love for reading. Books allow me to explore different worlds, ideas, and perspectives. Whether it’s fiction, science, self-development, or technology-related topics, I enjoy immersing myself in content that expands my understanding and sharpens my thinking. Reading not only entertains me but also helps me grow intellectually and emotionally. It’s a daily habit that I believe shapes my personality and fuels my curiosity.</li>
    <li>Another passion of mine is exploring the world of technology—especially how devices and gadgets are created. I enjoy learning about the design, components, and manufacturing processes behind the tech products we use every day. From smartphones to smartwatches, understanding what goes on inside these tools makes me appreciate the creativity and engineering skills involved. I often watch documentaries, read articles, or take virtual tours of tech factories and labs to stay updated with innovations and trends.</li>

I believe these interests will continue to play a major role in shaping my future career in the digital and AI-driven world.</li>
